<h1 align="center">🧠 How It Works</h1>

###

<h4 align="center">The snake is implemented as a singly linked list, where each node represents a segment of the snake's body. The head of the list is the snake's head. As the snake moves, a new head is added in the direction of movement, and the tail is removed — unless the snake eats food, in which case the tail is preserved.</h4>
